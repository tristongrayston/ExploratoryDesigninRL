# ExploratoryDesigninRL
Exploratoring design choices for RL to improve performance.

More or less inspired off the paper Empirical Design in Reinforcement Learning developed by Andrew Patterson at UofA. (link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01315). We hope to go over some of their results and see how they might apply to a relatively complex environment in Bipedal Walker.
